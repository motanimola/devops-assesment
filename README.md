# Assessment

Below you will find 3 levels of assessments ranging from Jr. devOps engineer, devOps Engineer, and Sr. devOps Engineer roles, each one being more complex than the next. Please choose at least one level/optione to demonstrate your technical aptitude and knowledge of devOps toolsets.

When terraform is used, modules should be used.
When ansible is used, playbooks that call agnostic roles should be used.

## Level 1
This should take no longer than 45min to complete

### Scenario
* This assessment assumes as a Jr. devOps engineer you are expected to find online or build a simple website (can be 1 page with "Hello World") running behind nginx using the below tools.
* As a devOps engineer your process for this should be automated, with 1-click build/deploy or 2-clicks separating 1-click build and 1-click deploy.
* You will find all files in the Lvl1 folder

#### Tools
* [Ansible](./Lvl1/Ansible.md)
* [Terraform](./Lvl1/Terraform.md)
* [Docker](./Lvl1/Docker.md)

## Level 2
This should take no longer than 1hr to complete

### Scenario
* This assessment assumes as a devOps engineer you need to evaluate a legacy docker container, developed by a former employee which you don't have access to. In this exercise you must evaluate the docker container, ensure the application loads correctly.
* You must optimize it to be as compact as possible, minimally by using alpine linux.
* You will find all files in the Lvl2 folder

## Level 3
These options can take a hour to a few hours to complete depending on your technical aptitude

### Option 1
#### Scenario
* This assessment assumes as a Sr. devOps engineer you are expected to manage a Jenkins server.
* You need to build a Jenkins pipeline that pulls its configuration from another git repository that can be centrally managed by the whole devOps team.
* This pipeline should support running a Node.JS applications coverage tests and report back to a tool such as github the build status.
* This should all be written in IaC and CM code of your choice and placed in the Lvl3 folder under a folder called Option1.
* Instructions for use and building this solution should be included in the Option1 folder as well.

### Option 2
#### Scenario
* This assessment assumes as a Sr. devOps engineer you are expected to be able to build and manage a ECS cluster in AWS.
* You need to build a ECS cluster in AWS using Terraform.
* Using a CI/CD tool such a Jenkins or CodeBuild, build a CI/CD flow that will monitor your git repository for changes to a docker file, build and push the dockerfile to ECR and deploy it to ECS for testing.
* This should all be written in IaC and CM code of your choice and placed in the Lvl3 folder under a folder called Option1.
* Instructions for use and building this solution should be included in the Option2 folder as well.
